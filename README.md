# CapNote

A tiny menubar-only macOS app that posts quick notes to your [Capacities](https://capacities.io) Daily Note via a global keyboard shortcut.

> Inspired by a BetterTouchTool setup that did the same thing — rebuilt as a standalone app.

## Features

- Lives in the macOS menu bar (no Dock icon).
- Configurable global keyboard shortcut to summon a quick-note window from anywhere.
- `⌘+Enter` sends the note to your Capacities Daily Note and closes the window.
- Built-in settings (rotated in via a 3D flip from the same window):
  - API token (stored securely in the macOS Keychain).
  - Target space (loaded from your Capacities account).
  - Window position: centered on screen, or where the cursor is.
  - Optional separator prepended to each note (default `---\n\n`).
  - Optional timestamp inclusion in the daily note.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later.
- A [Capacities](https://capacities.io) account with API access enabled (Settings → Capacities API).

## Install

1. Download `CapNote-x.y.z.zip` from
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/lardissone/cap-note/releases/latest).
2. Unzip it — you'll get `CapNote.app`.
3. Drag it into `/Applications`.
4. Open **CapNote** from Launchpad or `/Applications`. macOS will show
   the standard "downloaded from the internet, are you sure?" dialog
   the first time — accept it. The note icon shows up in the menu bar.

Quit via the menu's *Quit CapNote* or `pkill -x CapNote`.

> Releases are signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple, so
> Gatekeeper accepts them without any `xattr` workaround. Builds
> produced locally with the default ad-hoc identity still need
> `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` to launch from outside Xcode.

## Building from source

Requires a Swift toolchain that can resolve recent SPM dependencies
(KeyboardShortcuts ≥ 2.4, Sparkle ≥ 2.9). On macOS use Xcode 16+.

For a quick development run as a bare CLI process:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lardissone/cap-note.git
cd cap-note
swift run -c release
```

To produce a real `.app` bundle (matching what the release pipeline
ships), run:

```sh
bin/make-app.sh 0.0.0-dev      # → dist/CapNote.app, ad-hoc signed
open dist/CapNote.app
```

Pass `universal` as the second argument for a fat arm64 + x86_64 build.
Set `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` in the environment to sign with a real
Developer ID instead of the default ad-hoc identity.

To open the source in Xcode for editing/debugging:

```sh
xed .
```

## Usage

1. Launch the app — a small note icon appears in your menu bar.
2. Click the menu bar icon and choose **Settings…** — the note window opens with the settings face showing.
3. Paste your Capacities API token, click **Test & Load spaces**, then pick your space from the dropdown.
4. Set a **Global shortcut** (e.g. `⌘⌥N`). Optionally tweak window position, separator, and timestamp.
5. Tap the back arrow (or press `Esc`) to flip back to the note input.
6. From any app, press your shortcut → write a note → `⌘+Enter` → it lands in your Capacities Daily Note.

### Keyboard shortcuts inside the window

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `⌘+Enter` | Send the note and close the window |
| `Esc` | Close the note (or, when on the settings face, flip back to the note) |
| `⌘+,` | Toggle between note and settings face |

## Releases

Pushing a Git tag matching `v*` (for example `v0.2.0`) triggers
`.github/workflows/release.yml`, which:

1. Imports the Developer ID certificate from GitHub secrets into a
   temporary keychain.
2. Builds `CapNote.app`, signs every nested component (Sparkle XPC
   services, Updater.app, Autoupdate, framework, app) with hardened
   runtime + secure timestamp.
3. Submits the bundle to Apple's notary service and waits for the
   verdict.
4. Staples the notarization ticket onto the bundle.
5. Publishes the stapled `.app` zipped + SHA-256 sidecar as a GitHub
   Release.

```sh
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

The first time you set this up you need to add a handful of secrets to
the repository — see [`docs/release-signing.md`](./docs/release-signing.md)
for the full walk-through.

## Auto-update (Sparkle)

The app links Sparkle and exposes a *Check for Updates…* menu-bar item
plus the matching toggles in *Settings → Updates*. The bundled
`Info.plist` declares:

- `SUFeedURL` → `https://lardissone.github.io/cap-note/appcast.xml`
- `SUPublicEDKey` → the EdDSA public key of the maintainer's signing
  keypair.

The release pipeline signs every published zip with the matching
private key (held in a GitHub secret) and pushes a refreshed
`appcast.xml` to the `gh-pages` branch on every tag. See
[`docs/appcast-setup.md`](./docs/appcast-setup.md) for the one-time
setup steps.
